# City Events Site

A straightforward website for aggregating and displaying events from cities across the US, starting with Portland, OR. Inspired by [19hz.info](https://19hz.info/), which focuses on electronic music calendars, this project expands to include all types of events: music, art, festivals, markets, sports, community gatherings, and more.

The goal is a clean, no-frills interface that pulls events from various sources (e.g., APIs, calendars, or scraping) and lists them by city. Mobile-first design since development is happening on mobile!

## Features (Planned)
- **City-Specific Pages**: Starting with Portland—e.g., a simple list of upcoming events with dates, venues, descriptions, and links.
- **Event Aggregation**: Pull from sources like Eventbrite, Meetup, Google Calendar embeds, local news sites, or custom scrapers.
- **Search & Filters**: By date, category (music, food, outdoors), or keyword.
- **Multi-City Expansion**: Add Seattle, SF Bay Area, LA, etc., over time.
- **Simple Tech Stack**: PHP or Node.js for backend, HTML/CSS/JS for frontend (easy to edit on mobile). No heavy frameworks to start.

## Current Status
- Early stages: Repo setup and planning.
- Building on mobile—contributions welcome for code, data sources, or design ideas!

## Getting Started
1. **Clone the Repo** (if you have a laptop later): `git clone https://github.com/macjohnston/city-events-site.git`
2. **Install Dependencies**: (Add later, e.g., if using Node: `npm install`)
3. **Run Locally**: (e.g., `node server.js` or open index.html in a browser)
4. **Deploy**: Use GitHub Pages for static hosting or Vercel/Netlify for dynamic.

## Data Sources for Portland
- Eventbrite API: https://www.eventbrite.com/platform/api
- Meetup API: https://www.meetup.com/api/
- Local calendars: Portland Mercury, Willamette Week, or city sites like travelportland.com.
- (We'll add scraping ethics: Respect robots.txt, rate limits, and terms of service.)
